# About
The NDCA, aka National Dance Council of America, https://www.ndca.org/, houses all of the registered dance competitions in the US. Sometimes, the competitions do not publish the heat lists ahead of the competition. This can be frustrating to dancers and parents, because they may not know if the dances they have signed up for are uncontested. This python script aims to solve that by printing out all of the dance events and participants.

# Sample Output
```
Event: 123 PT-JR-Y Single Dance AC-P1 Open Silver Int'l Cha Cha

Event: 124 PT-JR-Y Single Dance AC-P1 Open Silver Int'l Samba
Participants: ['Dancer1 Name', 'Dancer2 Name']
```
